the first two question were easy then the third question in which we had to find the mex is a good question of pattern recognisation
in that question basically we had to sort the array and then find the array of max length in which the elements are consecutive 
because the elements has to start with the 0 in order to get the mex 


the fourth question had this TLE issue which can be solved with the use of the map in which what we can do is instead of altering the array 
we can alter the map value since the operations like m.clear() in the map is of O(n) time complexity
